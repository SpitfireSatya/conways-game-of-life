# AngularJS Puzzles

This is a starter project for developers to put their skills to the test by solving some fun puzzles using angularJS and setting up the seed for it as well.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:9000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Unit Tests

Run `npm run test` to execute unit tests using karma and written in mocha/chai/sinon. The generated coverage report will be written to `reports/coverage`.

## E2E Tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests written with protractor/cucumber. This will start the app at `http://localhost:9000/`, run the tests and stop the app.
(No need to start the app before executing tests)

## ESLint

Run `npm run lint` to execute the linter and display the details on cmd.
Run `npm run lint:fix` to fix all auto-fixable problems.

## Cucumber

Run `npm run cucumber` to run cucumber-js to view the missing feature skeletons.

## Protactor

Run `npm run protractor` to run the protractor tests. Ensure you have the app running at `http://localhost:9000/` before executing the tests.
